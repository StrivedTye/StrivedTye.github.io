Hi! I am currently postdoctoral teaching fellow at China University of Mining and Technology. 
Previously, I recieved a Ph.D. degree with the School of Mathematical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Xiu-ping Liu.
I was a visiting student at [SUTD Computer Vision & Learning Group](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~jun_liu/) from 2021 to 2022, advised by Prof. Jun Liu. 
I also did a intership at Hisen Intelligence Transport Group, Qingdao. 
My research interests include multimodal deep learning, point cloud processing and computer vision.
